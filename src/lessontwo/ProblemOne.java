/* Problem – 1
Create a class called Prog1. In the main method of the class, output to the console the result
of doing the following two computations:
    1. Get a random number x in the range 1 .. 9 and compute πx
    2. Get a random number y in the range 3 .. 14 and compute yπ
Use Math API to solve πx and yπ
To get the random numbers, apply the knowledge gained
from the Random Generator. Print the result two digits after decimal using System.out.prinf().
